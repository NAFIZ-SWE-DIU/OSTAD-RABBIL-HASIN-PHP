Question : Write your code solutions for each task.

Task 1: Variable
Declare a variable called $age and assign your age to it.

Task 2: Constant
Define a constant named PI and assign the value of Pi (3.14159) to it.

Task 3: Printing Output
Print the following sentence using the echo statement:
Hello, welcome to the world of PHP programming!

Task 4: Arithmetic Operations
Calculate and print the result of the expression: ((20 + 5) * 3) / 4.

Task 5: Conditional Operators
Write a conditional statement that checks if a variable $marks is greater than or equal to 60 and less than 80. If the condition is true, print "Passed," otherwise print "Failed."





<?php
// Task 1: Variable
$age = 25; // Replace 25 with your actual age

// Task 2: Constant
define("PI", 3.14159);

// Task 3: Printing Output
echo "Hello, welcome to the world of PHP programming!\n";

// Task 4: Arithmetic Operations
$result = ((20 + 5) * 3) / 4;
echo "Result of ((20 + 5) * 3) / 4 is: " . $result . "\n";

// Task 5: Conditional Operators
$marks = 70; // Replace 70 with the actual value of $marks

if ($marks >= 60 && $marks < 80) {
    echo "Passed\n";
} else {
    echo "Failed\n";
}
?>
